# JAVA Solutions for Leetcode

Remember solutions are only solutions to given problems. If you want full study checklist for code & whiteboard interview, please turn to [Aditya Verma videos](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAdityaVerma).

Also, there are open source implementations for basic data structs and algorithms, such as [Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) and [Algorithms in Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java).

I will upload 3-4 leetcode solution daily, and i will go in series
